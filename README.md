# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Builds the Front-End and Back-End and starts a `json-server`-based backend server that hosts everything.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser. Opens automatically.

You will also see any lint and server runtime logs and errors in the console.

### `start-be`

Builds the Back-End and starts the server.
If the Front-End is already built, that's enough to see at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### `build-fe`

Builfd the Front-End React app in production mode.
The output folder `build` is configured to be served as static files by `json-server`.

### `build-be`

Builds the Back-End but doesn't run it. Handy for error-checking.

### `build-all`

Builds both Front-End and Back-End together without starting the server.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
